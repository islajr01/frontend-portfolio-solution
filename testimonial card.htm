        <p>I find myself recommending roadmap.sh to all the internees or junior developers. It's a great way to skill up and grow in your career.</p>

        roadmap.sh is an incredible resource. I was fortunate to discover it during my university days in 2018. Back then, it was just a single repository with three images. It's amazing to see how much impact it has had on millions of lives since then.
